Enhancement tracking repository for DCM (Data Center Management).

## Is My Thing an Enhancement?

An enhancement is anything that:

- adds or removes significant capabilities
- needs significant effort to complete
- requires consensus across multiple repositories
- demands formal documentation

It is **not** an enhancement if it:

- fixes a bug
- adds more testing
- refactors code internal to one component

If unsure, file an issue and ask!

## Creating a New Enhancement

1. Discuss your idea with the team first (open an issue or bring it up in
   meetings)
2. Create from template: `make new NAME=your-enhancement-name`
3. Fill in the template
4. Format: `make format`
5. Open a PR for review

## Formatting

Lines must wrap at 80 characters. See `make help` for formatting commands.
